## 01_fuel_warning
Driver, 4 laps of fuel left. Monza's long straights favor pitting soon. Estimate 10-second stop. Your call.

## 02_tire_critical
Driver, box now! Front right tire temp critically high, 118C, degrading fast. Don't wait, box immediately!

## 03_gap_closing
Lewis, Verstappen's closing fast. Maintain your line, defend aggressively. Don't overcook Turn 1, save DRS for the straight.

## 04_lap_complete
Excellent lap, driver! Matching the leader's pace, keep pushing for P2!

## 05_position_change
Excellent work, driver! You're closing the gap. Stay focused, 12 laps to go, we've got this!

## 06_driver_query_tires
Tires are good. Front left at 95C/45%, front right at 98C/48%, rears at 88C/35%. Keep up the pace.

## 07_driver_query_strategy
Stay out on mediums, save them for the safety car. If no safety car, pit for softs on the final lap for a flyer.

## 08_safety_car
Driver, safety car deployed. Pit now for fresh softs. Immediate box-in required. 25 words, no more.
